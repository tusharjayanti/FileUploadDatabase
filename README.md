# FileUploadDatabase
Files upload and Download using C#

My try at C#.
Using this files can be upload and with further be saved or inserted to the DB tables. 
The uploaded (and then saved files) can be retrieved and displayed in HTML Table consisting of a Link for downloading 
the said file from the DB.
